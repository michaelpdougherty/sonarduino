Arduino Sonar GUI using distance, temperature, and humidity sensors to visualize data

This project was built using a <strong>SparkFun RedBoard</strong>, a <strong>DHT11</strong> temperature and humidity sensor, and an <strong>HC-SR04</strong> ultrasonic sensor.

This was programmed in the Arduino and Processing IDEs and relies on the DHT library to read temperature and humidity values.

Arduino files and libraries are found in the <code>arduino</code> folder and Processing files are found in the <code>processing</code> folder.

Using the Processing IDE, this project can be run in the IDE or exported as a pure Java application, though those packages were too large to upload each individual here.
